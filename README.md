# C++ Binary Fixed-Point Arithmetic

## Introduction

The [fixed_point](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/fixed_point)
library is designed to represent binary fixed-point real numbers using
built-in integer types. It is developed as part of
[SG14](https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/forum/#!forum/sg14).
For an overview of the API, see draft proposal,
[LEWG, EWG, SG14, SG6: D0037](https://github.com/WG21-SG14/SG14/blob/master/Docs/Proposals/Fixed_Point_Library_Proposal.md).
